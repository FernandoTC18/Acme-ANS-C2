This is a project derived from the initial "hello-world" project designed by the professor and coordinator of the course Design and Testing II, Dr. Rafael Corchuelo Gil. It will be developed by the initial laboratory subgroup 7, belonging to theory group 1.

This implementation is based on a fictional software designed _to help airports coordinate their resources and operations through the development of software solutions.
The goal of this project is to develop a WIS to assist airports in managing logistics for charter flights. This includes flight scheduling, 
booking management, crew management, incident reporting and resolution, as well as aircraft maintenance,_ as specified in the statement provided to the students.

To get this project up and running, please follow the guideline in the theory/lab materials,
taking into account that you must link the appropriate version of the Acme-Framework excluding
